### Networking-Golang
Contains projects from networking course, all done in Golang.
- Project 1 reads, writes, and sorts files consisting of zero or more records
- Project 2 performs a distributed sort of a file by partitioning the data and sending to multiple peer servers to be sorted
- Project 3 implements a HTTP server from scratch that listens for and accepts incoming requests then parses the request and responds according to HTTP protocol
- Project 4 uses gRPC to allow client and server interfaces to communicate and store files using a metafile to keep track of the database storage and synchronize across multiple clients
- Project 5 extends Project 4 to make it persistent by using multiple servers and only applying changes when there is a majority agreement as according to RAFT protocol
