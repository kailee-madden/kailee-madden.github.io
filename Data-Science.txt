Have worked on a Navy project doing a mix of data science, analysis, data pipeline engineering, and product management. 
This involves validating, preprocessing, and cleaning data, visualizing data in Tableau dashboards, 
working to automate the data ingestion process, leveraging a variety of tools and capabilities, 
such as Smartsheets and Python scripting, to further this automation process, directly presenting and 
working with clients on the rollout process, using Agile Scrum sprint methodology to manage time and scope, 
QA'ing current and previous products, and building out product requirements.

Assisted in an internal financial analysis effort for the Southern California Geo that required gather financial data 
from four sources, validating that data, aggregating it together using Excel Macros that I wrote, and providing digestable
summary statistics.
